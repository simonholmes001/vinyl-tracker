# Complete Protection Strategy

## 🛡️ **Two-Layer Protection System**

### **Layer 1: Local Pre-Commit Hooks (MANDATORY)**
- ✅ **Installed**: Pre-commit hook at `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
- 🚫 **Blocks commits** if unit tests fail
- ⚡ **Immediate feedback** in terminal
- 🧪 **Enforces TDD** at commit level

### **Layer 2: GitHub Branch Protection (RECOMMENDED)**

## 🛡️ **Enable Branch Protection on GitHub**

### **Step 1: Navigate to Repository Settings**
1. Go to: `https://github.com/simonholmes001/vinyl-tracker/settings/branches`
2. Click "Add rule" for branch protection

### **Step 2: Configure Protection Rules**
```
Branch name pattern: main

☑️ Require a pull request before merging
☑️ Require status checks to pass before merging  
☑️ Require branches to be up to date before merging

Required status checks:
☑️ Test and Build (from ios-ci.yaml)
☑️ PR Quality Checks (from pr-checks.yaml)  
☑️ SwiftLint (from ios-ci.yaml)

☑️ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100 MB
☑️ Do not allow bypassing the above settings
☑️ Require linear history
```

### **Step 3: Enable for Main Branch**
This prevents merging PRs that fail tests, ensuring main branch stability.

## 🔄 **Alternative: Pre-Commit Hooks**
For local validation before commit, add to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
cd VinylTracker_Clean/VinylTracker
echo "Running tests before commit..."
xcodebuild test -project VinylTracker.xcodeproj -scheme VinylTracker -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15,OS=17.0' -quiet
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Tests failed! Commit blocked."
    exit 1
fi
echo "✅ Tests passed! Proceeding with commit."
```
